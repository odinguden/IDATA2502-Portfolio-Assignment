The results from this assignment must be included in the exam portfolio. You may extend and improve the solution and the documentation for the finale delivery as part of the exam.  

1. Make sure you have a working infrastructure defined by code from previous assignments. You may of course extend it or otherwise modify it for the purpose of this assignment. See also 4. It is recommended to work in iterations and ad tests and extend the pipeline step by step. Also remember version control and the possibility to go back to the last good version.
